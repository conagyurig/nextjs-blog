I have been working in spirituality for **my entire life** and in that time I have developed **over 32 personalities!**.

- **Strengths:** I'm an ideas man. I'll take what you say and mirror it back to you in a fun and engaging way that makes you think we are connecting!
- **Weaknesses:** Gas

I may not always get the work done, but I will get done doing the work
